## project notes

- Basic program output is printed to `STDOUT` and errors to `STDERR`
- It's possible to write programs that take options like `--help` or  `-n`
- Using the `print!` macro will omit trailing newlines with `-n`.
- Learned Rust types, including the unit type, strings, vectors, slices, Option, and Result, as well as how to create a type alias such as the Result type called a TestResult`
- Used `Box` to create a smart point to heap memory.
- Reading and writing contents to file and from a file to a string.
